# Welcome to My GitHub

Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Auberson Kevin, and I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in computer science and communication systems, networks and systems orientation from [HEIG-VD](https://heig-vd.ch/).

This page provides an overview of the courses I took and the projects I completed. You will find direct links to each project hosted on my GitHub. I hope you find these projects interesting and representative of the skills I have acquired.

## Projects

### 1. PRG 1 (P
**Description:** The course content covers the basics of programming, the fundamentals of C++, control structures, functions, arrays, strings, classes and objects, genericity and exceptions. Students will learn to write their first program in C++, use variables and operators, control the flow of execution with conditional structures and loops, define and call functions, manipulate arrays and strings, design classes and objects, use templates for generic programming, and handle exceptions to handle errors robustly.

**Project(s):**
[PRG1_22-23](https://github.com/kevinAuberson/PRG1-22-23)

### 2. ISD 
**Description:** This course teaches the use of scientific computing tools in Python, including the Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Sklearn libraries. Students will learn how to implement supervised learning approaches for classification and regression, including data preparation, model creation and validation, and performance evaluation. They will use techniques such as cross-validation and the analysis of criteria such as F-score and ROC curves. The course will also cover unsupervised learning and the interpretation of the results obtained.
